<p>My name is Pratik, I am not really a cat though, but for now, I will use this pic as in placeholder for my pics.
  <br/> I am a undergraduate student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at VIT University, Vellore. Web development sounds very interesting and hence I decided to jump in.
  <br/> Need a few projects as well, hehe.

<p>I like to read fiction novels, sketch some arts and also play video games. I do watch movies as well, but I am a much bigger fan of video-games. Feel free to ask for suggestions, might have something for you.</p>
